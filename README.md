# Sales Order PDF Report Generator - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

This repository contains AL code for a web service in Dynamics 365 Business Central. It generates various types of sales order reports in PDF format.

## Overview
The `ProcessReport` codeunit receives a JSON object with the parameters 'Document No', 'Document Type', and 'Report ID'. It uses these to generate a specific sales order report, which is returned as a base64 string for easy data exchange.
